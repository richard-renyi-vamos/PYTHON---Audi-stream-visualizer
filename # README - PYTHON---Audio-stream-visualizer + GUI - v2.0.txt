create a PYTHON code that visualizes the voice in the audio stream

Here’s a Python script that visualizes the voice in an audio stream in real-time. The visualization will include a waveform and a spectrogram. The pyaudio library is used to capture audio from a microphone, and matplotlib is used for visualization.

Make sure you have the required libraries installed:

bash
Copy code
pip install pyaudio matplotlib numpy
Here’s the code:

Audio Visualizer
This script does the following:

Captures audio data from your microphone in real-time.
Displays the waveform (amplitude vs. time).
Computes and visualizes the spectrogram (frequency vs. time).
Make sure to connect a microphone to your system, and allow permissions if prompted. 🎙️📊🎶✨

# Constants

CHANNELS = 1  # Number of audio channels
RATE = 44100  # Sampling rate (44.1 kHz)

Edited
The code now includes a GUI built with Tkinter to visualize the audio stream in real-time. You can run the script, and the waveform and spectrogram will appear in a window with live updates. 🎨📊✨
